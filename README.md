# RaspberryPi-Fan-Controllor
This code will make you RaspberryPi with a DS18B20 (a temperature sensing device) temperature sensing!

I got the code off of a website called circut basics: http://www.circuitbasics.com/raspberry-pi-ds18b20-temperature-sensor-tutorial/

I am doing this for a science project and I am trying to make fans turn on when it gets to a certain temperature. But, I don't know how I can make the fans turn on, let me know if you have any ideas!
